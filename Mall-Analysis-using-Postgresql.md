# Mall-Analysis-using-Postgresql

## Introduction

#### I generated hypothetical questions that clients would ask if they were interested in building a mall. Granted, the mall Kaggle dataset was limited, but I solved  some business questions with it. In my analysis, I found that the country with the highest number of malls is the Philippines.It seems that the Philippines has the highest share of malls in the world but why?

#### Compared to the rest of the countries the Philippines has a smaller land mass than the US and China. The reason that keeps popping up is that the Philippines has a hot and humid climate. Therefore it makes sense to build malls for people to chill when the temperature goes up.

## Trend of Mall building Throughout the Years

#### There is generally a flat trend over the years except when the Iran Mall was built in 2018. The years have been arranged in ascending order. There has been no clear upsurge in malls over the years in the countries.

## Conclusion
### There is a clear increase in the building of malls in Asia especially in the 2000s.This is mainly due tothe record growth in population in Asian countries and also growth in their economies leading to increase in purchasing power.
